I'm a CS student testing how to use git and github through this repo.


I am making changes through local editor/VS code and using git add and git commit.

git add . for adding all files in directory. "." for all files, can specify a file as well

git commit -m "message" for saving changes to local git folder/repository with a message. 
git commit is used after git add.

For git push, need to prove to github that i am the owner of the account. So i need to generate SSH keys locally.
The command is ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myemail"
